deprecations:
  - |
    The ``mistral_workflow`` resource type has been using the credential
    written in the ``[keystone_authtoken]`` section of ``mistral.conf``.
    However this behavior has been deprecated and now the resource types first
    looks for the yaml files in ``/etc/openstack/puppet``. Make sure one of
    ``clouds.yaml`` or ``admin-clouds.yaml`` (which is created by
    puppet-keystone) is created in that directory.
